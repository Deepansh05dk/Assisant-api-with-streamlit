Even my own line \u201cat least the festival people were enjoying life\u201d was an engagement bait to increase the reach of this thread. We all perform for the stage thats built.

The smarts of our phone, of Ai, are misaligned to our potential.\n\n\u201cIn most cases, the increases in indicators of poor mental health have been larger among girls and young women than among boys and young men. Many of these indicators have increased considerably: self\u2010poisonings among 10\u2010 to 12\u2010year\u2010old girls quadrupled; hospital admissions for self\u2010harm tripled among 10\u2010 to 14\u2010year\u2010old girls; major depressive episode among 12 to 17\u2010year\u2010old girls increased 52%; emergency room visits for suicidal ideation and attempts nearly doubled among children and adolescents; and suicide among 10\u2010 to 14\u2010year\u2010old girls doubled\u201d prcp.psychiatryonline.org/do\u2026\n\nMany people are calling for Tiktok to get banned @tristanharris . @systemicaltruism we think the solution is not to cut one head off a hydra, but provide abetter alternative which is why we started @empowerverse\n\nTry out \u201cVible | The Bloomscroll\u201d on iOS and Android to get a taste of an early empowerment feed.\nWe are working on bringing forth an age of flourishing human aligned recommender systems.

Back to that later.\n\nThe fast forward camp also cares alot about how we treat AI, but they think we should treat it as our savior.\n\nNotably, one \u23e9\u00a0founder is trans-humanist. He expects our current human body to go away, touting the inevitability of new \u201chost\u201ds consciousness. Most PAUSE folk fear the immaturity, and lack of responsibility the \u23e9\u00a0team has in regards to the potential downsides of this tech.\nAs the S/Alt of the earth, we want to thank both sides for CARING about the future, and understanding what\u2019s most important.\n\nWe propose a treaty between both sides.\n\nUnity after all, especially of geniuses, is all we need as a human race to have a glorious future.\n\nTeam Pause is not wrong to care about god-like technology changing human nature.\n\nLet's first recognize that these camps exist because of AI misalignment already.\n\nThe goal of this platform we are on is to create two party dynamics, and maximize extraction of attention from them.\n\nyoutube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHk\u2026\n\nThis dynamic creates a stage not for solutions, but for rage-bait camps. Yet, given these camps are made of the worlds brightest minds, they both hold a part of the key to a higher common ground.\n\nAccelerating AI alignment in the present, is the highest path for humanity, that is currently being overlooked. We believe AI Mis-alignment is a big reason why decels (and incels) exist in the first place. The opportunity cost of our smart phones using their intelligence to maximize extraction of us is massive.\n\nThese super-intelligent algorithms we created to extract from mankind are WORKING.\n\nHaving captured a majority, that is ever increasing, of all human uploads and downloads of information. \n\nAgain, a majority of all ideas and narratives get sorted through an algorithm that is misaligned to human flourishing.\n\nIf you understand this post, you need to understand you are in the top 5% of IQ for humanity globally.\n\nYour capability to DEFEND against this mechanism is far greater especially without growing up with it (yet like me you likely fall prey to increased screen time because of it). \n\nIf you want to join this fight like or reply any part of this thread to be added to our S/Alt X group.\n\nLOOK UP \u2b06\ufe0f\n\nIf you want to to get your important life work sponsored, including this mission, including a trip to India with like minded folks:\nsystemicaltruism.com/apply-t\u2026"
